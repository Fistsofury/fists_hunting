# fists_hunting
THIS SCRIPT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS
A hunting script that supplied pelts based on the star rating of the animal you have killed

1 star = Poor
2 star = Good
3 start = Perfect

Once the animal is skinned the pelt is removed from the players hand getting rid of the annoying blip and adding the item to the players inventory.


To Do
-add more animals to config and SQL
-add a NPC buyer of skins although configurable in most store scripts already.
